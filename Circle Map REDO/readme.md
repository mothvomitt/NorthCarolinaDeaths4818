# First Interactive Web Map
## I decided to look at NCOSBM data for death in raw numbers among each North Carolina county. 
### Functions:
- This web map symbolizes the number of deaths in each county as proportional circles. 
- Legend deciphers the map with proportional symbols using a min, mid, and max value.
### Data
- NCOSBM (Number of Deaths)
- OpenDataSoft (Lat & Long of each county point)
## Libraries
- Leaflet Version 1.9.4
- jQueary v3.1.1
- Leaflet Demo Provider (basemap)
## Reflection 
This lab was definitely a lot easier with bigger context for how to symbolize. I will say my biggest struggle was creating the legend and properly symbolizing it. Another issue I ran into was making sure I had lat and long coordinates for my data points, and I ended up hunting down a website that had all of the geopoints mapped out already, and combined that with the data that I acquired from NCOSBM.
